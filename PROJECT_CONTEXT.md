## Technical Details

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.13.9** (Streamlit Cloud environment)
- **Streamlit >=1.29.0** - Web UI framework
- **OpenAI API >=1.0.0** - GPT-4o model for AI analysis
- **PyMuPDF >=1.24.0** - PDF processing (Python 3.13 compatible)
- **Pandas >=2.2.0** - Data manipulation (Python 3.13 compatible)
- **OpenPyXL >=3.1.2** - Excel export
- **Pillow >=10.2.0** - Image processing (Python 3.13 compatible)

### Important Design Decisions

1. **Company-Agnostic AI Classification**
   - System works with ANY inspection company (T√úV, DEKRA, or others)
   - No hardcoded company names or formats
   - AI uses natural understanding without bias
   - No hardcoded definitions of site vs non-site defects

2. **Classification Understanding**
   - **Bauseitige M√§ngel**: Site-related defects (building/structure issues)
   - **Nicht-Bauseitige M√§ngel**: Non-site-related defects (lift equipment & documentation)
   - AI decides classification based on context, not rigid rules

3. **PDF Processing**
   - Uses PyMuPDF instead of pdf2image (no poppler dependency)
   - Converts PDFs to 300 DPI images for better OCR
   - Processes each page individually
   - Compatible with Python 3.13

4. **API Key Management**
   - Uses Streamlit secrets (st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
   - Falls back to input field for local testing
   - Never stored in code or git repository
   - Configured in Streamlit Cloud dashboard

5. **Table Display**
   - Aggregated by PDF file (file name as section header)
   - Color-coded: #ffcccc (red) for Bauseitige, #cce5ff (blue) for Nicht-Bauseitige
   - Black text on colored background for visibility
   - File column removed from rows (shown in header instead)

6. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**
   - All dependencies use flexible version constraints (`>=`)
   - Updated to latest package versions supporting Python 3.13
   - Tested and working on Streamlit Cloud's Python 3.13.9 environment

### Key Code Sections

**PDF Conversion (streamlit_analyzer.py ~line 50)**:
```python
def pdf_to_images(self, pdf_path: str) -> List[Image.Image]:
    """Convert PDF pages to images using PyMuPDF"""
    images = []
    pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    for page_num in range(len(pdf_document)):
        page = pdf_document[page_num]
        mat = fitz.Matrix(4.0, 4.0)  # 300 DPI
        pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)
        img = Image.frombytes("RGB", [pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)
        images.append(img)
    pdf_document.close()
    return images
```

**AI Classification Prompt (streamlit_analyzer.py ~line 150)**:
```python
prompt = f"""
You are analyzing a defect from an elevator/lift inspection report.

{context}

Classify this defect as either:
- "Bauseitiger Mangel" (site-related defect - related to the building/structure)
- "Nicht-Bauseitiger Mangel" (non-site-related defect - related to the lift equipment itself or documentation)

Use your understanding of what constitutes a site defect versus a lift equipment defect.

Also provide an English translation of the defect description.

Return JSON:
{{
    "classification": "Bauseitiger Mangel" or "Nicht-Bauseitiger Mangel",
    "confidence": "High" or "Medium" or "Low",
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you classified it this way",
    "english_translation": "English translation of the defect description"
}}

Return ONLY valid JSON.
"""
```

**API Key Configuration (streamlit_analyzer.py ~line 30)**:
```python
try:
    api_key = st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
except:
    api_key = st.text_input(
        "OpenAI API Key",
        type="password",
        help="Enter your OpenAI API key"
    )
    if not api_key:
        st.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Please enter your OpenAI API key above")
        st.stop()
```

## User Preferences & Requirements

### Must-Haves (User Specified) - ALL COMPLETED ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Company-agnostic (works with any inspection company)
2. ‚úÖ No hardcoded definitions or bias in AI prompts
3. ‚úÖ English translation included
4. ‚úÖ Table colors visible (dark enough to see)
5. ‚úÖ Table aggregated by file (no repeating file names)
6. ‚úÖ No API key input bar (uses secrets in production)
7. ‚úÖ Public URL deployment (Streamlit Cloud - LIVE)

### User Corrections During Development
1. **Company Specificity**: "this not just for tuv dekra it can be from any other company we need to rely on the power of chat gpt AI for itself to decide what is reelvant not enforcing a bias on it"

2. **Classification Understanding**: "i think you understand site and non stire realted defects incorrectly, site defects are those that has to do with the building not the lift itself"

3. **AI Bias**: "we bacailly do not need to make the ai baised at all we just rely on its classification knowing that these are lift related dfects do not tell it what an on site and non on site is no hard defeiintion should be passed"

4. **UI Elements**: "remove this line 'Works with ANY inspection company - T√úV, DEKRA, or others'"

5. **Table Colors**: "the chosen color for the classifcation col in the table is too bright that it's not nearly visible!"

6. **Table Aggregation**: "the table view is still not aggreagted per a unique pdf file!"

---

## Errors Encountered & Fixed

### 1. Poppler Dependency Error (Development Phase)
**Error**: "Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?"
**Fix**: Replaced pdf2image with PyMuPDF (fitz) - no external dependencies needed

### 2. OpenAI API Version Error (Development Phase)
**Error**: "You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0"
**Fix**: Updated to OpenAI API v2.5.0 syntax with `OpenAI()` client

### 3. Deprecated Model Error (Development Phase)
**Error**: "The model gpt-4-vision-preview has been deprecated"
**Fix**: Changed model from `gpt-4-vision-preview` to `gpt-4o`

### 4. GitHub Push Protection Error (Development Phase)
**Error**: "Push cannot contain secrets" (detected OpenAI API key in elevator_inspection_analyzer.py)
**Fix**: Removed old file with hardcoded key, amended commit, force pushed clean code

### 5. GitHub Authentication Error (Development Phase)
**Error**: "fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address"
**Fix**: Used Personal Access Token in remote URL

### 6. Python 3.13 Compatibility Error (Deployment Phase) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Error**:
```
√ó Failed to download and build `pillow==10.1.0`
KeyError: '__version__'
√ó Failed to download and build `PyMuPDF==1.23.8`
```
**Root Cause**: Streamlit Cloud uses Python 3.13.9 by default, but the pinned package versions (Pillow 10.1.0, PyMuPDF 1.23.8, pandas 2.1.3) were not compatible with Python 3.13

**Fix**: Updated requirements.txt to use flexible version constraints with Python 3.13 compatible versions:
- `PyMuPDF==1.23.8` ‚Üí `PyMuPDF>=1.24.0`
- `Pillow==10.1.0` ‚Üí `Pillow>=10.2.0`
- `pandas==2.1.3` ‚Üí `pandas>=2.2.0`
- Changed to `>=` constraints for future compatibility

**Lesson Learned**: Always use flexible version constraints (`>=`) instead of pinned versions (`==`) for better compatibility with evolving Python versions on cloud platforms.
